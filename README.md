# Psych_790_Final
DSHB Psych 790 Final

This is our final project for the class Psych 790 for the Data Science in Human Behavior (DSHB) program. We are using the 2022 edition of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) dataset. Our outcome variable is covidsmp, consisting of responses to the question: "Did you have any symptoms lasting 3 months or longer that you did not have prior to having coronavirus or COVID-19?" We will be using machine learning techniques to create a predictive algorithm using the other variables in the dataset, and we will use a train-test split to quantify this algorithm's performance.

Currently, we plan to deliver 3 files:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in R/Quarto: this file will contain an initial cleaning and exploration of data in R.

Random Forest and Feature Importance Analysis in Python: this file will contain a Random Forest and Feature Importance Analysis whereby the predictor variables for our algorithm will be identified.

Logistic Regression in R/Quarto: this file will contain a Logistic Regression which takes as input the predictor variables determined in the Random Forest/Feature Analysis.
